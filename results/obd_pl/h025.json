A list of names of old and young, Christians and heathens, freemen and servants, white and black, inhabittinge within the township of Southold, 1698:\nJonathan Horton, Bethia Horton, Jonathan Horton, Jr., William Horton, James Horton, Mehetabel Horton, Mary Horton, Abigail Horton, Patience Horton, Joshua Horton, Mary Horton, Ephraim Horton, Mary Horton, Jr., Bathia Horton, Elizabeth Horton, Zeruiah Horton, Caleb Horton, Sarah Horton, widow, Penelope Horton, Mary Horton, widow, Caleb Horton, Jonathan Horton, David, Barnabas, and Phebe Horton, Joshua Horton, Jr., Eliza Horton, Eliza Horton, Jr., Patience Horton, Deborah Horton, Martha Horton, Bethia Horton, Barnabas Horton.\nDocumentary History, vol. iii., p. 855.\u2014Capt. James Horton, 1775, takes a census of slaves in Westchester County, New York, in which he sets down to himself 1 male and 1 female negro.\nSame vol., p. 863.\u2014Rev.

We commence with the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genealogical data, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and order of births. In many of the early families the exact order of births cannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as nearly as possible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member of the family. The Roman numerals indicate the order of births. The sons and daughters of the old Puritan, Barnabas, constitute the second generation, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph I., Hannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none too much to make it plain and easy to study.\nThis little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of the Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are given only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not been satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.\n",

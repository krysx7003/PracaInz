The western part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659\u201360. The east or two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper room of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years, as we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of the old benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved. The old \"castle,\" as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant, used to call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America. I know of no dwelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now standing, that can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. There were a few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 1640\u2014two or three it is said on Shelter Island. But these, as well as those built by the Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all passed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation buildings can be found except this one. It remained for the house that Barnabas built to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble representative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago. But the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others by its age, but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that we find two generations of the same name, living and dying in the same house\u2014rarely find three. But here we have six generations in succession, all bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same house, and all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan. We may go to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search long and diligently, and fail to find a parallel case.\nWith a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far in the future.\nIt requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time since the old house was built.
